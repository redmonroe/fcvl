## top level

- requirements:

  - finish tests and formalizing queries into funcs
  - make rent receipts flow
  - incremental processing of files (comes from statusRS)
  - make rent sheets (JUST USE PANDAS)
    - midmonth scrape (how does this work with rent sheets)
    - mm scrape: make load a loop instead of just one shot
  - RENT RECEIPTS:
    - rent receipts and letter class
    - add letter generated col to db
    - need to either loop on fcv_workflows or run automatically
  - S/M: export files for audit once they are processed, async, profiling, cython, frontend api structure
  - structure:
    - use interfaces and getters when referencing other classes
