## Purpose

The purpose of this collection of code is to automate the entire financial cycle for my work. This includes:

1. scraping reports and data from the web
2. preparing monthly financials
3. preparing annual financials
4. generating receipts and work orders

This project is to be realtime. It will use Python, Flask, sqlite, and Postgres for the backend. The front end will be made using Google Sheets Tailwind and Remix/React.
